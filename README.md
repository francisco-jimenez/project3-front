### About MatchEat

Match eat is an application where you can find the best dishes from your favorite restaurants. It uses a system similar to the popular "tinder" dating app, where you swipe right if you want to save food or left if you're not interested.
In addition, with the filtering system, it recommends some options or others depending on the type of plan you have.
You can also access a map with the location of the restaurants, the websites of the restaurants and visit the opinions of other users.

To do this, register and let yourself be carried away by the magic of match eat
